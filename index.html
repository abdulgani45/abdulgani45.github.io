    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>I’m Abdul Gani, currently pursuing a degree in Economics at IIUM and working as a Crisis Management Specialist at TDCX. This portfolio is a reflection of my values, work ethic, and journey.</p>

    <h2>Reflection: Quran & Sunnah in Work Ethic</h2>
    <p>As a Muslim professional, my work ethic is deeply rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, which guide every aspect of my conduct and decision-making. Islam places great importance on values such as honesty (siddiq), trustworthiness (amanah), excellence (itqan), and patience (sabr) — qualities that I strive to uphold in every professional setting. For example, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, “Verily, Allah loves that when anyone of you does a job, he should perfect it” (al-Bayhaqi). This hadith inspires me to pursue excellence and quality in all my responsibilities.

In my current role at TDCX, where I handle crisis management for a hotel platform, I am often required to make quick yet fair decisions involving customers and clients. Upholding justice (‘adl) is vital, and I refer to the Quranic principle in Surah An-Nisa (4:58): “Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice.” My job demands integrity in making payout decisions and dealing with insurance claims. I consider it a form of fulfilling amanah — the trust placed upon me.

Additionally, patience and resilience are core values emphasized throughout the Quran. During high-pressure situations or difficult customer interactions, I remind myself of Surah Al-Asr which speaks of the virtue of patience and truth. This helps me maintain composure and professionalism. The concept of ihsan — to do everything as though Allah is watching — keeps me grounded and spiritually motivated even in a corporate setting.

By integrating Islamic ethics with my daily responsibilities, I not only aim to fulfill my job description but also to attain personal growth and spiritual contentment. I believe that work, when done sincerely and ethically, becomes a form of worship and a means to serve both people and God.</p>
