    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>Assalamu'alaikum and hello! My name is Abdul Gani bin Mohamed Iqbal, matric number 2013961. I am a Year 3 BBA student at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). This personal portfolio was developed for my USRAH 1 course and aims to reflect my personal growth, faith, and ethical development throughout the semester.</p>

    <h2>Reflection: Quran & Sunnah in Work Ethic</h2>
    <p>This reflection is based on lessons from USRAH 1 and my personal understanding of Islamic teachings. In the first week, I was introduced to the goals and structure of the course, which helped set expectations. In the second week, we explored Hadith Jibril, which clarified the pillars of Islam, Iman, and Ihsan. This was foundational in shaping my mindset toward becoming a holistic Muslim professional who integrates spiritual consciousness into everyday life.</p>

    <p>In the following weeks, we studied the Pillars of Iman and the significance of Ihsan. I learned that Ihsan means doing everything with excellence as though Allah is watching. This resonated with me deeply, especially in my role as a student and a crisis management specialist. It reminded me to always act with sincerity, maintain high performance, and strive for moral excellence in both academic and workplace settings.</p>

    <p>Our discussion on Islamic eschatology highlighted life after death and the importance of accountability. Knowing that all actions are judged encouraged me to reflect on my behavior, intentions, and the importance of integrity. Lessons on neighborly kindness and honoring parents taught me that Islam is a religion of compassion, not just rituals. These values drive my interactions with colleagues, clients, and family alike.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, USRAH 1 has deepened my appreciation of Islamic values and how they guide every part of life — especially work ethic. The emphasis on sincerity, justice, excellence, and accountability reinforces my goal to be a responsible Muslim who contributes positively to society and fulfills both worldly duties and spiritual obligations with balance.</p>
