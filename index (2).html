    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>Assalamu'alaikum and hello! My name is Abdul Gani bin Mohamed Iqbal, matric number 2013961. I am a Year 3 BBA student at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). This personal portfolio was developed for my USRAH 1 course and aims to reflect my personal growth, faith, and ethical development throughout the semester.</p>

    <h2>Reflection: Quran & Sunnah in Work Ethic</h2>
    <p>This reflection is based on lessons from USRAH 1 and my personal understanding of Islamic teachings. The values of sincerity (ikhlas), excellence (ihsan), and justice ('adl) emphasized in the Quran and Sunnah inspire how I approach work and relationships. I aim to apply these principles to my university tasks, teamwork, and professional responsibilities — treating every action as a trust (amanah) and act of worship when done with intention and integrity.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>

    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>I was introduced to the structure of the USRAH 1 course and its learning goals. The lecturer shared key expectations and assignments, helping me mentally prepare and understand the importance of spiritual and social development alongside academics.</p>

    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p>We explored Hadith Jibril, which highlighted the core foundations of Islam: Islam, Iman, and Ihsan. This gave me a clearer understanding of how faith and behavior are deeply linked in Islam. The concept of Ihsan touched me the most — to act as if Allah sees us.</p>

    <h3>Week 3 & 4</h3>
    <p>I learned about the six pillars of Iman: belief in Allah, His angels, books, messengers, the Day of Judgment, and divine decree. These beliefs form the compass for a Muslim’s values and actions, guiding me in how I conduct myself daily.</p>

    <h3>Week 5</h3>
    <p>The topic of Ihsan was revisited with a focus on spiritual sincerity and ethical excellence. I realized that true Ihsan improves not only worship but also how we treat others and how we grow personally. It's a mindset of continuous self-improvement.</p>

    <h3>Week 6</h3>
    <p>We discussed the importance of kindness to neighbors and honoring parents. Islam's emphasis on compassion and respect reminds me to maintain strong ties with family and community, and to always act in a way that builds love and trust.</p>

    <h3>Week 7</h3>
    <p>Reflection was given to our experiences during the course. I appreciated the collaborative nature of the group and realized how vital it is to share insights, support each other, and embrace the lessons of humility and gratitude.</p>

    <h3>Community Campaign Experience</h3>
    <p>Between 2017 and 2019, I served as a Campaign Manager at Lifemakers Malaysia. I attended community events and conferences to promote charitable causes, networked with officials to increase awareness, and set fundraising goals. I also developed strategies for outreach and community participation. These efforts helped me understand leadership, public engagement, and the role of teamwork in achieving social goals — all of which align with Islamic ethics of service (khidmah) and sincerity.</p>
